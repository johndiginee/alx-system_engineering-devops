What distribution algorithm your load balancer is configured with and how it works
Round Robin: Round Robin passes each new connection request to the next server in line, eventually distributing connections evenly across the array of machines being load balanced. 

Is your load-balancer enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup, explain the difference between both
In an active-passive configuration, the server load balancer recognizes a failed node and redirects traffic to the next available node. In an active-active configuration, the load balancer spreads out the workload's traffic among multiple nodes.

How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works
Master-slave replication enables data from one database server (the master) to be replicated to one or more other database servers (the slaves). The master logs the updates, which then ripple through to the slaves.

What is the difference between the Primary node and the Replica node in regard to the application
What is a replica node?
Master replica nodes are responsible for duplicating the functionality and data contained on master nodes within a Kubernetes cluster configured for high availability.
Primary nodes
What is primary node and secondary node?
Primary nodes hold cluster settings and all node states which are synced between primaries

Where are SPOF
A single point of failure (SPOF) is a potential risk posed by a flaw in the design, implementation or configuration of a circuit or system. SPOF refers to one fault or malfunction that can cause an entire system to stop operating.

Security issues (no firewall, no HTTPS)
What happens if there is no HTTPS?
Without HTTPS, any data passed is insecure. This is especially important for sites where sensitive data is passed across the connection, such as eCommerce sites that accept online card payments, or login areas that require users to enter their credentials

No monitoring
Just as the heart monitor in a hospital that is making sure that a patientâ€™s heart is beating and at the right beat, software monitoring will watch computer metrics, record them, and emit an alert if something is unusual or that could make the computer not work properly happens.
